## Project Overview 

At **Ensemble startup**, as a Software Developer, I contributed to the development of a **desktop application** for their 
web-based studio, extending the platform’s accessibility beyond browsers and enabling users to store their **YAML files** 
on local system to use in **Offline mode** and seamlessly push them to their own **GitHub profiles**.

My role involved **building the application using Electron**, ensuring a **cross-platform, responsive, and intuitive** user 
experience while also **enhancing API communication** by transitioning API calls from the frontend to structured **Node.js API 
endpoints** using the **Repository Pattern**. This approach significantly improved **performance, scalability, security, and 
maintainability** of the system.  

Additionally, I implemented **test case coverage using Jest**, ensuring reliability and robustness in API interactions. Through 
this project, I deepened my expertise in **Electron, API architecture, automated testing, and full-stack development**, making 
meaningful contributions to **Ensemble’s mission** of empowering developers with efficient and scalable solutions.

## Domain and Industry Context

To fully appreciate the significance of this project, it's essential to understand the context of industry in which Ensemble 
operates. Ensemble is part of the **low-code/no-code (LCNC) and developer productivity industry**, which is changing how software 
is built by making app development faster, easier, and more accessible.This industry helps reduce the need for extensive coding 
skills, allowing more people—from startups to enterprises—to create digital solutions efficiently.

Ensemble is making this process even smoother with its **user-friendly platform** that lets people build apps quickly without 
writing complex code for not only web application in **React** but also mobile application in **Flutter**. It also integrates 
**AI-driven tools** and **natural language interactions**, Ensemble is helping developers and non-developers alike bring their 
ideas to life with minimal effort and easy to deploy tools and environment.


## Key Contributions & Impact

1. Developed a desktop app for **Ensemble React-based Web Studio** within a time-bound contract, ensuring **100% cross-platform 
compatibility** across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. **Built & optimized API communication** by transitioning calls from frontend to structured **Node.js endpoints**.
3. Setup **Repository Pattern** for APIs to benefit from a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend 
them. 
4. **Achieved 30% test coverage** for the **Firestore Cloud Functions** using Jest, ensuring **robust functionality & reduced 
production bugs**.
5. Design a **File system** to locally store the data to be used in offline mode and sync after connection is restored. 
6. **Enabled offline editing & real-time synchronization**, integrating **Firestore Cloud Functions**, allowing users to create and 
update applications in Ensemble Studio in Offline Mode.
7. **Integrated Git functionality**, allowing users to push Yaml code to hosting services like **GitHub & Bitbucket**.
8. Setup **Firebase emulator** to run and test cloud functions locally.

## Conclusion

Working at Ensemble was a valuable experience that significantly enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills. Developing a 
cross-platform desktop application using Electron improved my expertise in building scalable applications, while implementing the 
Repository Pattern in Node.js and Express strengthened my understanding of structured API design and maintainability.

I gained hands-on experience with Firestore Cloud Functions, enabling real-time synchronization and offline mode, which deepened 
my knowledge of cloud-based architectures. Integrating Git functionality for seamless YAML code deployment to GitHub & Bitbucket 
further improved my understanding of version control and automation.

As I reflect on this project, I’m struck by how it has contributed to my growth as a developer for both technical and 
non-technical skills like, working in an Agile/Scrum environment with GitHub Boards that improved my ability to manage tasks 
efficiently and collaborate effectively. Overall, my time at Ensemble strengthened my expertise in full-stack development, 
API design, cloud-based solutions, and automated testing, preparing me for more complex challenges ahead.
