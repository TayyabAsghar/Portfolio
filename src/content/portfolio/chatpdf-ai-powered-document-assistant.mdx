## Project Overview 

ChatPDF is an AI-powered document assistant that allows users to upload PDFs (on Cloudinary) and interact with them using natural language 
queries. Built with Next.js, it leverages Pinecone for storing embeddings of documents, Langchain to use AI Integrations for example Google 
Gemini AI or ChatGpt to enable seamless document analysis, key information retrieval, and summarization. The app is designed for students, 
professionals, and researchers who need quick insights from large PDF documents.

## Objectives

The project aimed to achieve the following:

1. **Develop a Full-Stack AI-powered document assistant Platform** – Enable users to upload their PDF files and enable seamless document analysis,
 key information retrieval, and summarization with the power of AI.
2. **Implement Secure Authentication** – Use **Clerk** to support **email/password and social logins (Google, Facebook)** with 
profile management.
3. **Implement Subscription Plans** – Use **Stripe** to support Free & Pro-tier with monthly subscription plans that user can manage through Stripe
Portal.
4. **Enable AI-driven interactions** – Use **Pinecone** to store embeddings of documents for fast semantic search and **LangChain** to 
integrate Gemini for answering user quires.
