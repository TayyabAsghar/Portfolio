## Project Overview 

This project is a **full-stack social media web app**, inspired by **Threads** and I named it YASAC (Yet Another Social App Clone) for fun, designed to foster user engagement through 
**thread creation, nested commenting, community interactions, and real-time notifications**. Users can **sign up, post threads, 
follow/unfollow other users, join communities, and manage profiles** while enjoying a **smooth and responsive experience** across 
all devices. Features like **private profiles, community management, and admin-specific content** add depth to the platform, making 
it more interactive and scalable.
 
The application is built using **Next.js 14+** with **Server Side Rendering (SSR)** for optimized performance and SEO benefits. 
**MongoDB** handles complex data structures, while **Clerk** provides secure authentication, supporting social logins. **UploadThing** 
enables seamless media uploads, and **ShadCN UI & TailwindCSS** create a modern and intuitive interface. The backend utilizes 
**serverless APIs, webhooks, and middleware** for efficient request handling, and **Zod & React Hook Form** ensure data validation 
and form management.

## Objectives

The project had several key objectives that motivated me:

1. **Develop a Full-Stack Social Media Platform** – Enable users to create, engage, and interact with threads, comments, and 
communities.  
2. **Implement Secure Authentication** – Use **Clerk** to support **email/password and social logins (Google, Facebook)** with 
profile management.  
3. **Enhance User Engagement Features** – Introduce **thread creation, nested commenting, user activity, follow/unfollow users, 
like threads, and real-time search** to improve interaction.  
4. **Build a Responsive and Intuitive UI** – Utilize **ShadCN UI & TailwindCSS** for a modern, seamless user experience across all 
devices.  
5. **Optimize Performance with SSR** – Implement **Next.js 14+ Server Side Rendering (SSR)** for **faster load times and better 
SEO**.  
6. **Enable Media Uploads** – Integrate **UploadThing** for smooth **image and file sharing** within threads and communities.  
7. **Develop Community Management Features** – Allow users to **create/join communities, and invite members**.  
8. **Implement Private Profiles & Access Control** – Let users control their visibility and restrict thread access when needed.  
9. **Improve API Architecture** – Use **serverless APIs, middleware, and webhooks** to optimize request handling and sync data.  
10. **Ensure Data Integrity & Validation** – Utilize **Zod & React Hook Form** for structured data validation and secure user input.  
11. **Enhance Deployment & Scalability** – Deploy on **Vercel** for high performance and scalability.  
12. **Follow Best Practices in Code Reusability & Structure** – Implement a modular, maintainable codebase following modern 
development standards.

## Conclusion

Building the **YASAC** was an invaluable experience that strengthened my skills as a **full-stack developer**. This project allowed 
me to work with **Next.js 14+**, leveraging **Server Side Rendering (SSR), Server Side Functions, and middleware** to optimize 
performance and security. Implementing **MongoDB** with **complex schemas and role-based access control** deepened my understanding 
of database management and efficient data handling.  

Through **Clerk authentication, webhooks, and real-time event listening**, I gained hands-on experience in managing **secure user 
sessions and interactive user engagement**. Working with **UploadThing for media uploads**, **React Hook Form & Zod for form 
validation**, and **ShadCN UI with TailwindCSS for responsive design** helped me create a seamless, scalable, and visually appealing 
application across all devices. One of the key aspects of this project was integrating the Tiptap text editor, which provided a 
rich-text editing experience for users creating and formatting their threads. 

This project also refined my skills in **Git workflow, CI/CD deployment on Vercel, automated testing, and scalable API 
architecture**. Overall, it significantly improved my ability to **design, develop, and deploy full-stack applications**, 
reinforcing my expertise in **modern web development, performance optimization, and user-centric design**.
