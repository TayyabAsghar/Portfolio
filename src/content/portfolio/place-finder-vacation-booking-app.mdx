## Project Overview

Place Finder is a responsive web platform designed to help travelers effortlessly discover and book accommodations near 
popular tourist destinations. The project includes key features such as a dynamic landing page, rental listings with detailed 
cards, and a booking system with an integrated calendar.

Beyond its core functionality, the primary goal of this project was to deepen my expertise in web development. I focused on 
implementing a custom user authentication system, incorporating password salting and hashing for security, along with access 
and refresh tokens for seamless authentication. This hands-on approach enhanced my understanding of secure user management and 
improved my proficiency in full-stack development.

## Objectives

The project had several key objectives that guided my development process:

1. **Develop a responsive and user-friendly web platform** that allows travelers to easily search, browse, and book accommodations
 near popular tourist destinations.
2. **Implement a secure user authentication system** using password salting and hashing, along with access and refresh tokens 
for enhanced security and session management. 
3. **Integrate key booking features** such as listing cards, detailed rental pages, and an interactive calendar for seamless 
reservations.  
4. **Enable users to add their own property listings**, allowing hosts to provide details such as location, pricing, amenities, 
and availability, expanding the platformâ€™s accommodation offerings.
5. **Ensure scalability and maintainability** by following best coding practices and structuring the codebase for 
future enhancements.
6. **Document the development process and key learnings** to serve as a reference for future projects and continuous 
improvement.

## Conclusion 

Working on **Place Finder** has been a transformative experience, allowing me to expand my technical expertise by integrating 
external services and implementing advanced security practices.

By using **Cloudinary**, I optimized image delivery, enhancing website performance and user experience. Implementing 
**JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens** deepened my understanding of secure user session management, while 
**salting and hashing passwords** reinforced my knowledge of authentication best practices. Additionally, optimizing 
**MongoDB queries** improved database efficiency, ensuring seamless data retrieval. This project not only strengthened my 
full-stack development skills but also refined my ability to build scalable, secure, and high-performance web applications.
