## Project Overview 

AgentTube is an AI-powered content creation assistant made with Next.JS that analyzes YouTube videos and enhances content generation 
using advanced AI models like Claude and Gemini. By providing a video link, users can generate transcripts, receive AI-suggested video 
titles, create improved or alternative scripts, and generate AI-powered thumbnails using OpenAI image generation model.

## Objectives

The project aimed to achieve the following:

1. **Develop a Full-Stack AI-powered content Agent** – Enable users to analyze YouTube videos and instead of only providing summary 
to user use AI tools to generate video **Transcripts**, **Titles**, **Thumbnails** and **Scripts** with the help of multiple models.
2. **Googl API** – Use Google API services to get video details like transcription, thumbnail and metadata and store it to **Convex** 
database to caches.
3. **Vercel AI SDK** – Use Vercel AI SDK with Gemini Model to create tools that **Chat with user**, generate **Scripts**, and **Titles** 
and with OpenAI Model to generate **AI Thumbnails** for video. 
4. **Implement Subscription Plans** – Use **Schematic** and **Stripe** to support Free, Starter, Creator and Enterprise with monthly 
and yearly subscription plans that user can manage through schematic elements.
5. **Features Tokens** – Use **Schematic** to create features and tokens that then we can attach with user plans to provide certain 
functionality or limited access to a feature based on user plan.
6. **Implement Secure Authentication** – Use **Clerk** to support **email/password and social logins (Google)** with profile management.

## Conclusion

Building **AgentTube** was a really rewarding experience. From product point of view the goal was to create something useful for 
content creators — a tool that could turn YouTube videos into better titles, cleaner scripts, engaging thumbnails, and full 
transcripts, all powered by AI but from developer or learning point of view the goal was to understand AI agents (Vercel AI SDK) and 
AI tools along with proper AI prompting. Seeing that idea come to life was pretty awesome.

One of the best parts for me was working with the Vercel AI SDK and integrating models like Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI. It gave me 
hands-on experience with building real, interactive tools powered by AI — not just answering questions, but actually helping users 
create. It pushed me to think differently about user interaction and how AI can fit naturally into creative workflows.

I also got to dive deeper into user authentication, subscription plans, and feature control using tools like **Clerk**, **Stripe**, 
and **Schematic** — which made me more confident in building complete, production-ready apps.

Overall, AgentTube taught me a lot — not just about tech, but about designing things that feel intuitive, helpful, and fun to use. 
It really leveled up my skills with AI integration, and I'm excited to build even more tools like this in the future.
