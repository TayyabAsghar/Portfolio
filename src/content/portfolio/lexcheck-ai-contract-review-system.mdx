## Project Overview 

At **LexCheck** startup, I contributed to the development of an **AI-driven contract review platform** that revolutionizes the way 
businesses handle contract negotiations. The platform seamlessly integrates with **Microsoft Word**, allowing users to **review, 
redline, and finalize contracts with AI-powered insights** while maintaining complete control over legal language. By leveraging 
**Large Language Models (LLMs)**, LexCheck provides **instant contract analysis**, identifies problematic clauses, and applies 
**preferred negotiation positions automatically**, streamlining the contract lifecycle.  

My work focused on **enhancing contract lifecycle management** more importantly known as **LexCheck insights**, ensuring 
**real-time contract redlining**, creating dashboards for different types of users like **Contract Dashboard, Playbook Editor 
Dashboard, User Dashboard, Admin Dashboard**. The system improves efficiency by eliminating **manual legal bottlenecks**, reducing 
risk, and enabling businesses to close deals **faster and more accurately**. With a strong emphasis on **security**, all contract 
data is **AES-256 encrypted**, ensuring compliance with **legal industry standards**.  

This project reinforced my expertise in **LLM-powered AI applications, secure document processing, contract automation, and 
enterprise-grade integrations**, further strengthening my ability to build **scalable, AI-driven solutions** that optimize 
business workflows.

## Domain and Industry Context

LexCheck operates in the legal technology (LegalTech) and AI-driven contract automation industry, which is transforming how 
businesses handle contract review, negotiation, and risk management. Traditionally, contract reviews have been a time-consuming, 
manual process requiring extensive legal expertise, often leading to delays in deal closures and increased operational costs. 
However, with advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and automation, the contract lifecycle 
management (CLM) industry is evolving toward faster, more accurate, and cost-effective solutions.

By integrating LLM-powered AI contract review directly into Microsoft Word, LexCheck eliminates inefficiencies in contract 
negotiations, reducing the reliance on manual legal reviews while ensuring compliance with best practices. The platform automates 
redlining, applies preferred legal positions, and minimizes contractual risks, enabling legal, sales, and procurement teams to 
accelerate deal closures and enhance accuracy.

By developing a website that effectively review the contracts, we're not just creating a SaaS Platform â€“ we're providing a window 
into the future of contract reviewing technology. Our goal was to design an online experience that reflects the sophistication and 
effectiveness of LexCheck product, helping potential customers understand the transformative power of AI-driven Contract Reviewing 
solutions.

## Features

### Landing Page

The landing page serves as the digital front door for Attryb, designed to make a powerful first impression and clearly communicate the company's value proposition. Using React.js, we crafted a clean, modern interface that immediately captures visitors' attention with a bold hero section featuring a concise tagline and a prominent call-to-action.

As users scroll, they're greeted with smoothly animated sections that highlight key features of Attryb's AI-powered Marketing Stack, each accompanied by eye-catching illustrations or icons. We implemented a sticky navigation bar to ensure easy access to different sections of the site, enhancing overall user experience and encouraging exploration.

### Content Studio

The Content Studio product page showcases one of Attryb's core offerings, demonstrating how businesses can streamline their content creation process. We leveraged React's state management capabilities to create interactive demos that allow visitors to experience the power of AI-driven content generation firsthand. The page features a dynamic interface where users can input basic parameters and watch as the AI generates tailored content suggestions in real-time.

### Pricing Page

Transparency in pricing is crucial for SaaS products, and our pricing page was designed with this in mind. Using flexbox and CSS media queries, we created a responsive layout that clearly presents Attryb's different pricing tiers. Each plan is displayed in a card format, with a hover effect that subtly highlights the card to improve user interaction.

We implemented a toggle switch that allows users to easily switch between monthly and annual pricing options, with the annual discount prominently displayed to encourage long-term commitments. The page also features an FAQ section addressing common pricing-related queries, helping to alleviate potential customer concerns and streamline the decision-making process.

## Outcome

The launch of the new Attryb website marked a significant milestone for both the company and our development team. The site has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from users and stakeholders alike, with particular praise for its intuitive navigation, engaging animations, and clear communication of Attryb's value proposition.

One of the main challenges we faced was optimizing performance across a wide range of devices while maintaining the rich, interactive elements that make the site stand out. Through careful code splitting, lazy loading of components, and meticulous attention to asset optimization, we were able to achieve excellent performance metrics, with the site consistently scoring above 90 on Google's Lighthouse performance audits.

A key lesson learned during this project was the importance of close collaboration between design and development teams from the earliest stages. By involving developers in the design process, we were able to identify potential performance issues early and craft solutions that maintained the design vision without compromising on speed or responsiveness.

Looking ahead, we've identified several areas for future improvement:

1. Implementing a more robust A/B testing framework to continually optimize conversion rates.
2. Exploring the use of WebAssembly for even better performance in computationally intensive areas of the site, particulary data visualization based demos.
3. Expanding the use of micro-interactions to further enhance user engagement and guide users through the site.
