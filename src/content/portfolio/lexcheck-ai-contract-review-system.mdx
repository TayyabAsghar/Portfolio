## Project Overview 

At **LexCheck** startup, I contributed to the development of an **AI-driven contract review platform** that revolutionizes the way 
businesses handle contract negotiations. The platform seamlessly integrates with **Microsoft Word**, allowing users to **review, 
redline, and finalize contracts with AI-powered insights** while maintaining complete control over legal language. By leveraging 
**Large Language Models (LLMs)**, LexCheck provides **instant contract analysis**, identifies problematic clauses, and applies 
**preferred negotiation positions automatically**, streamlining the contract lifecycle.  

My work focused on **enhancing contract lifecycle management** more importantly known as **LexCheck insights**, ensuring 
**real-time contract redlining**, creating dashboards for different types of users like **Contract Dashboard, Playbook Editor 
Dashboard, User Dashboard, Admin Dashboard**. The system improves efficiency by eliminating **manual legal bottlenecks**, reducing 
risk, and enabling businesses to close deals **faster and more accurately**. With a strong emphasis on **security**, all contract 
data is **AES-256 encrypted**, ensuring compliance with **legal industry standards**.  

This project reinforced my expertise in **LLM-powered AI applications, secure document processing, contract automation, and 
enterprise-grade integrations**, further strengthening my ability to build **scalable, AI-driven solutions** that optimize 
business workflows.

## Domain and Industry Context

LexCheck operates in the legal technology (LegalTech) and AI-driven contract automation industry, which is transforming how 
businesses handle contract review, negotiation, and risk management. Traditionally, contract reviews have been a time-consuming, 
manual process requiring extensive legal expertise, often leading to delays in deal closures and increased operational costs. 
However, with advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and automation, the contract lifecycle 
management (CLM) industry is evolving toward faster, more accurate, and cost-effective solutions.

By integrating LLM-powered AI contract review directly into Microsoft Word, LexCheck eliminates inefficiencies in contract 
negotiations, reducing the reliance on manual legal reviews while ensuring compliance with best practices. The platform automates 
redlining, applies preferred legal positions, and minimizes contractual risks, enabling legal, sales, and procurement teams to 
accelerate deal closures and enhance accuracy.

By developing a website that effectively review the contracts, we're not just creating a SaaS Platform â€“ we're providing a window 
into the future of contract reviewing technology. Our goal was to design an online experience that reflects the sophistication and 
effectiveness of LexCheck product, helping potential customers understand the transformative power of AI-driven Contract Reviewing 
solutions.
