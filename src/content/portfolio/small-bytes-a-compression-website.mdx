## Project Overview

Small Bytes is a web-based platform designed to demonstrate a custom-built data compression algorithm. Developed as part of an 
undergraduate coursework project, this initiative aimed to implement an efficient compression technique from scratch and deploy it 
in a cloud-based environment for real-time file compression. The platform allows users to upload files, compress/decompress them 
using the algorithm, and retrieve the compressed/decompressed output, showcasing both algorithmic efficiency and practical usability.

## Objectives & Contributions

### **My Contributions**

#### **Compression Algorithm Design & Implementation**
- Developed the core compression algorithm from scratch, focusing on optimizing data reduction while preserving accuracy.
- Ensured that the algorithm effectively handled various file types with minimal loss of information.

#### **Backend Development**
- Designed and implemented the server-side logic responsible for processing compression requests.
- Deployed the backend in a cloud-based environment, ensuring seamless scalability and high-performance execution.

#### **File Handling**
- Managed file upload, processing, and delivery between the client and the server.
- Implemented support for three different types of file encodings, ensuring compatibility across various file formats.

- Evaluated both time and space complexity to optimize execution speed and resource efficiency.

### **Collaborator's Contributions**

#### **Frontend Development**
- Designed and implemented an intuitive, responsive web-based interface to facilitate user interaction with the compression platform.
- Ensured seamless integration between the frontend and backend to provide a smooth user experience.

#### **Brand Identity & UI/UX Design**
- Created a cohesive brand identity, including logo design and branding elements.
- Utilized design tools like Figma to develop a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

#### **Algorithmic Analysis**
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm’s performance using Big O, Big Θ, and Big Ω notations.

## Conclusion

Small Bytes successfully demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a custom data compression algorithm in a real-world, 
cloud-based environment. By dividing responsibilities, I focused on algorithm design, analysis, backend development, and file 
handling, while my collaborator contributed to frontend development, branding, and UI/UX design. The project not only reinforced 
our technical and analytical skills but also provided hands-on experience in full-stack web development and collaborative 
problem-solving.
