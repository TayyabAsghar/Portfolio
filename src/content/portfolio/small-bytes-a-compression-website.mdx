title: "Small Bytes | A Compression Website"
description: "Small Bytes is a Web-Based Free Compression Tool. It uses the LZW Compression algorithm to compress your files. This application is a university project. It is very simple and easy to use. This project is basically implemented to show how LZW Compression works. This Web Application is made using React, TailWind CSS and Node.js."

## Project Overview

As part of my undergraduate coursework, I collaborated with a fellow student to develop Small Bytes, a web-based platform 
designed to showcase a custom-built data compression algorithm. The project aimed to implement a compression technique from 
scratch and deploy it in a cloud-based environment for real-time file compression.

### My Contributions:
- **Compression Algorithm Design & Implementation:** Developed the core algorithm from scratch, ensuring efficient data compression 
while maintaining accuracy.
- **Algorithmic Analysis:** Conducted a detailed analysis of the algorithm’s performance, evaluating its time and space complexity 
using Big O, Big Θ, and Big Ω notations.
- **Backend Development:** Built and deployed the server-side logic to handle compression requests, ensuring smooth and scalable 
cloud-based execution.

### Collaborator's Contributions:
- **Frontend Development:** Implemented the web-based interface, ensuring an intuitive and responsive user experience.
- **Brand Identity & UI/UX Design:** Designed the logo and branding elements, potentially using Figma, to create a visually 
appealing and cohesive platform.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in algorithm design, backend development, and performance analysis, while also 
emphasizing teamwork and cross-functional collaboration.
